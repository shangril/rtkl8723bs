# Realtek 8723bs Linux WIFI driver in the hope that it won't trigger errors and warnings (likely to be treated as errors).
Especially working on it for the Pine A64 LTS V1 & V2 optional add-on card for wifi and bluetooth that uses this Realtek chipset. Target Kernel is ArchLinux For Arm (alarm) on aarch64 architecture (ARM 64 bit) currently in-repo ; that is to say 5.19 !

# This Repo is not intended to be used as-is. It will be a source repo for use with a repo called (same name)-dkms-git with dkms (obvioulsy) and a PKGBUILD for use with makepkg under alarm 

## The REAL documentation will be provided in the README.md of this -dkms-git and updated there...

...if only the module compiles, and insert somdays. 
Wish me well. WIP. Not usable, at all, completely, for now. 

Forked from muhviehstah ! GPLed by Realtek itself initially ! If working, will be used to create a DKMS + PKGBUILD secondary repo & include in AUR. Stay tuned.
